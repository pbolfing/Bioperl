The tables were created using the following code in sqlite3

create table friend (
     friend_ID INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
     first_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
     last_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
     cat_ID_1 INTEGER NOT NULL,
     cat_ID_2 INTEGER,
     cat_ID_3 INTEGER
);

create table category (
     cat_ID INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
     cat_descrip VARCHAR,
     cat_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

create table retailer (
     retailer_ID INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
     retailer_descrip VARCHAR,
     retailer_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

create table gift (
     gift_ID INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
     gift_descrip VARCHAR,
     gift_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
     manu_ID INTEGER NOT NULL,
     price DECIMAL(,2) NOT NULL,
     cat_ID INTEGER NOT NULL,
     retailer_ID INTEGER NOT NULL
);

create table manufacturer (
     manu_ID INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
     manu_descrip VARCHAR,
     manu_name VARCHAR(255)
);

The idea for this database is that each friend can have up to three gift
categories, with one being required. Then to search for gifts for your friend
you simply query cat_ID for that friend and return the gifts with their name,
description, price, retailer and whatevery other metadata is available. So this 
relationship is one to many with the one being the category and the many being the gift.
The relationship of the friend to category is one to one just repeated a couple times
to ensure proper coverage of friends interests.
