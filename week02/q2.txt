#! /bin/sh

#For this question I read it as copy only the files from the subdirectories to the new directory and so I implemented the following script to do this

	for i in cgi html ; do
		cp -r ~/my_project/$i/* ~/public_html
	done

#	$cp -r ~/my_project/{cgi,html}/* ~/public_html

# I have an example of this in /week02/proj2. Here I copied the cgi and html files I created in ~/week02/practice/proj/{cgi,html} respectively, into /week02/practice/proj2/public_html.
