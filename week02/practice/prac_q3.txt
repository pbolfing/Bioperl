#For this question I read it as copy only the files from the subdirectories to the new directory and so I implemented the following script to do this

	for i in cgi html ; do
		
	#	if [[ /home/pbolfin1/proj/week02/practice/proj/$1/* -nt /home/pbolfin1/proj/week02/practice/proj2/public_html/* ]]; then

			cp -r -u /home/pbolfin1/proj/week02/practice/proj/$i/* /home/pbolfin1/proj/week02/practice/proj2/public_html
	# 	fi	

	done

#	$cp -r ~/my_project/{cgi,html}/* ~/public_html

# I have an example of this in /week01/proj2. Here I copied the cgi and html files I created in ~/week01/proj/{cgi,html} respectively, into /week01/proj2/public_html.

# Now if I wanted to copy the files and keep the subdirectory structure, I could do this with a very similar script to the one above

#	$cp -r ~/my_project/{cgi,html} ~/public_html
