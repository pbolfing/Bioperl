I am choosing to use Vi as my choice, for now. The reason for this is two fold, one Vi is universal and two Vi is the editor that I have the most experiece with, though it is still rather limitied.  I will continue to play around with emacs because it appears to have some advantages over Vi and my in the future find it more useful. But for now I will run with Vi and see how I do.
