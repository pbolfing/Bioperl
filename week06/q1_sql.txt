The tables that I created can be found in the test database in proj/week06.

The tables were created using the following code in sqlite3


create table mRNA (
     gene_ID INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
     gene_Name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
     org INTEGER NOT NULL,
     gene_Seq VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
     tis INTEGER NOT NULL,
     express INTEGER NOT NULL,
     start_RF INTEGER NOT NULL,
     stop_RF NOT NULL
);

create table organism (
     org_ID INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
     org_Name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

create table tissue (
     tis_ID INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
     tis_Name VARHCAR(255) NOT NULL
);

create table express_Level (
     express_ID INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
     express_Lev VARCHAR(255)
);


I realize as I am typing this up that since the expression level is a number an not a string, it doesn't need its own table because it depends on the gene.  When I designed these tables, I was thinking that there was various levels of expression that could be given based on a string and so allow for easy updating I put expression in its own table.  To see the table layout see week05 q4.osb.
