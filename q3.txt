#! /bin/sh

#I know the hint was to use the test command but I was having issues get the sytax for more than one file down, but found the -u option for cp and found it did the same thing

	for i in cgi html ; do
		
	#	if [[ ~/my_project/$1/* -nt ~/public_html ]]; then

			cp -r -u ~/my_project/$i/* ~/public_html
	# 	fi	

	done

#	$cp -r ~/my_project/{cgi,html}/* ~/public_html

# I have an example of this in /week02/practice/proj2. Here I only copied the cgi and html files I updated in ~/week02/practice/proj/{cgi,html} respectively, into /week02/practice/proj2/public_html.
